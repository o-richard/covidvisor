The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, airborne particles, and contact with contaminated surfaces, making it a significant global public health concern. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that its primary mode of transmission occurs through airborne droplets released during coughing, sneezing, or talking by infected individuals. Additionally, fomite transmission, which involves contact with contaminated surfaces followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, has also been identified as a potential route. Clinically, COVID-19 presents with a variety of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The most common symptoms include fever, persistent cough, fatigue, headache, sore throat, and shortness of breath. Unique symptoms such as anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) have been recognized as early indicators of infection. Atypical symptoms are more likely to manifest in older individuals or those with compromised immune systems, including reduced alertness, fatigue, and mobility challenges. Certain risk factors significantly increase the likelihood of severe disease, notably in individuals aged over 60 and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory conditions, and obesity. COVID-19 severity is categorized into three primary levels: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild cases involve symptoms limited to the upper respiratory tract without shortness of breath or hypoxia. Moderate cases are characterized by an oxygen saturation level (SpO2) of 90-93% on room air and a respiratory rate of 24 or more breaths per minute, indicating pneumonia but no signs of severe respiratory distress. Severe cases, however, present with significant respiratory challenges, including SpO2 levels below 90% and a respiratory rate exceeding 30 breaths per minute, often necessitating intensive care. Effective management of COVID-19 varies depending on the severity of the case. Mild cases are typically managed through home isolation, symptomatic treatment, and regular monitoring of temperature and SpO2 levels. Moderate cases require hospitalization, where patients are provided oxygen therapy, anticoagulation therapy, and corticosteroids as needed. Severe cases necessitate advanced care in intensive care units, including mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and continuous monitoring for complications like septic shock. Infection prevention and control measures are critical in mitigating the spread of the virus. Healthcare workers are advised to use personal protective equipment (PPE), including N-95 masks, especially during aerosol-generating procedures. Hand hygiene, regular disinfection of surfaces, and maintaining physical distance are universally recommended practices. Diagnostic efforts for COVID-19 involve laboratory tests such as RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs being the preferred sample types for accurate detection. Several investigational therapies have been employed under specific circumstances. For instance, Remdesivir, under emergency use authorization, is administered to patients with moderate to severe disease within 10 days of symptom onset. Tocilizumab, an immunomodulatory agent, may be considered for severe cases exhibiting elevated inflammatory markers and inadequate response to steroid therapy. Preventing complications is another integral aspect of COVID-19 management, involving strategies like early patient mobilization, glycemic control, prophylactic anticoagulation, and vigilant monitoring for secondary infections or ICU-acquired conditions. Finally, discharge policies and post-COVID management guidelines emphasize the importance of follow-up care for patients recovering from COVID-19. Long-term complications, including fatigue, respiratory difficulties, and psychological distress, require careful attention to ensure comprehensive recovery.
