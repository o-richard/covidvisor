# Dependencies

- Linux
- `alsa-utils` - **arecord** (version 1.2.13) is used for voice recording from the microphone. Other alternative is PortAudio (cross-compatible)
- `espeak-ng`- **espeak** (version 1.52) is used for text to speech. Other alternatives are festival.
- `Assembly.AI account` - **assembly.ai** is used for speech to text. Other alternatives are Google Speech to Text.
- Python - A virtual environment should be created. The directory is `venv`. Install requirements from requirements.txt on the virtual environment. The first time calling `scripts/main.py` could take a while since some resources need to be download - subsequent calls are faster. The models in `scripts/custom_models.py` should be trained prior. Based on the results, the classification_model & ner_model paths can be updated in `scripts/process_intent_and_parameters`
- Go - All dependencies should be downloaded. Data should be seed into the database on the initial build/run.
